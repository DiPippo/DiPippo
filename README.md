I have no idea what this is all about but the REFPROP TEAM suggested I use this site since they could not answer my question. Sadly, the question is pretty basic and should be solved by anyone familiar with the latest REFPROP software and Excel.
Until my old Compaq computer died, I was using Refprop both as a stand-alone program and as an Excel add-in. I bought a new computer, HP All-in-One and the Best Buy Geeks transferred the data from my old hard drive (undamaged) to the new machine. Refprop did not transfer, and a new version of Excel came bundled with the HP, Excel 2021.
None of my old Excel spreadsheets that were built with Refprop now function. I see #NAME? instead of values.
After fiddling around trying to follow the instructions for embedding Refrop into Excel, I managed to move two Refprop files into Excel. When I first opened one of my old programs, I saw actual values but as soon as I touched any cell, BAM! The dreaded #NAME? appeared everywhere instead.
I planned to show below some annotated screenshots that may help you understand what I am doing wrong.

But they did not copy. So I guess this will be a useless attempt at help.


This whole business of Trusted Locations is a mystery to me.
 
Here are the two Refprop add-ins that I managed to insert. I once saw a page that had little boxes to the left of each item that could be checked; I no longer can find that page.
 
This what shows up when I select a cell that should give the saturation pressure of a saturated liquid water for a given temperature. Note the extraneous characters between the = sign and pressure. When I deleted those characters, nothing changes, still #NAME?.  
 
Another example that used to work perfectly on my old system. I wonder if the Calling Function has been changed in the latest refprop?

I tried a different Calling Function, to no avail.
I suspect there are multiple problems with my process of getting Refprop into Excel, but I do not understand why it is so difficult, at least for me. Thanks for whatever help you can offer. Ron
